#SONAR Rock vs Mine Prediction

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify whether an object is a rock or a mine based on SONAR data. SONAR (Sound Navigation and Ranging) data provides the frequency response of objects, which is used in this project to differentiate between rocks and mines (metal cylinders). The classification task is crucial in naval mine detection to prevent underwater threats.

Project Overview
The SONAR dataset contains 208 samples with 60 features that represent energy levels bounced back by sonar signals at different angles. Each sample is labeled as either Rock (R) or Mine (M). The goal is to build a model that accurately predicts the class of an object using its SONAR readings.

Key Steps Involved:
Data Preprocessing: Normalization, handling missing values, and preparing the dataset for training.
Feature Selection: Analyzing the most relevant features for improving model accuracy.
Model Selection: Comparing various machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
Evaluation: Using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model performance.
Model Deployment (optional): Implementing the model into a live system for real-time prediction.

Technologies Used:
Python: Programming language used for data manipulation and model building.
Scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning models.
Pandas & NumPy: For data preprocessing and manipulation.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization and result analysis.
Dataset:
The dataset used is the SONAR Dataset available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
It consists of 208 rows and 61 columns, with 60 numerical features and 1 output column (Rock or Mine).
